<h2>Mobile Game Platform 2.0</h2>

Hive is a platform that provides various functions required to serve mobile games to global users. With Hive, you can shorten the time to develop mobile games, effectively increase game users, and encourage user participation. This mobile game platform is currently available not only with the games published by Com2uS and Com2uS Holdings, but also with various types of games from other companies.

To service mobile games using Hive, it is necessary to integrate Hive SDK into game clients.
Hive SDK supports iOS and Android-based platforms, and provides three plug-ins for language support such as C++ and Objective-C, and for game engine support such as Unity, Unreal Engine, and Cocos2d-x.

Hive logo in games uses the image provided by Platform Department, and is marked with the capital <strong>H</strong> when using text. To download the logo image, check the <a href="https://com2us.com/include/platform/img/Hive_BI.zip">Hive Brand Guide</a> at the bottom of the Com2uS Platform homepage.

<h2>Provisioning</h2>

Hive Provisioning manages a process from Hive SDK initialization to server maintenance popup.

<h4>Terms of Service</h4>

The game should display or get agreement on Terms and Privacy Policy to all users to protect the userâ€™s right and comply with the rules. If the following circumstances are occurred at the time of initialization, Hive platform distinguishes the country of each user and exposes the agreement on Terms and Policy to users depending on the setting condition on Hive Console.

<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
    <li>When user starts a game for the first time.</li>
    <li>When the revision (version change) of the terms is required.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

In Hive Console, you can register the Terms of Service and set to display the agreement popup on Terms from users in ten countries; Korea, the United States, Japan, China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macao, Russia, France, and Germany. Even the agreement popup on Terms is not exposed when user executes the game, you should implement the Terms of Service feature at a proper location in the game.

<ul>

<blockquote>
  According to Article 50 (Restrictions on Transmission of Advertising Information for Profit) of Act on Promotion of Information and Communication Network Utilization and information Protection, you should get agreement prior to send the commercial information by push service to Korean users.
  If user opted in to Night-time Notification, you can expose commercial information at night. For this, Hive supports the feature to get agreement on receiving commercial information in daytime and at night from users.
</blockquote>

&nbsp;

<blockquote>
  Push notifications sent from Hive Console are blocked if users opt out of commercial information. That is, the pushes by Hive Push API from game server as well as Local Push are regarded as non-commercial information.
</blockquote>

&nbsp;

<h4>Update/Server Maintenance/Notice Popups</h4>

For the game service, it is necessary to block the version after the update of the game client, or to block the game connection during the maintenance of the game server. Hive provides the functions to expose popups in the order of <strong>Forced game update, notification/server maintenance</strong> in accordance with the information configured in Hive Console. In the game, you can use the UI provided by Hive SDK or implement the customized UI by receiving the information from Hive.

<table class="custom-basic">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="width: 30%;"><strong>Game Update by Force</strong></td>
<td style="width: 70%;">Block to use the specific version of games and provide a link for update</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Server Maintenance</strong></td>
<td>Available to set the maintenance status by game server, and recommended to provide official community links by game during the server maintenance</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Notice</strong></td>
<td>Use to expose the important notice or update information not by force to all users</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<aside class="note">
<p class="">Update/Maintenance popup is a part of initialization step. Server maintenance popup should be also exposed in the step of server selection, regardless of automatic or manual selection, so make sure to implement the maintenance popup to be displayed requisitely.</p>

    <li>Hive IAP v4 purchases items, verifies receipts, sends logs. Sending item is managed by game server.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Hive IAP v2</h4>

Hive IAP v2, the payment module, reduces development time by unifying the purchasing process and allows you to quickly respond to changes in the market. This module manages the process such as the receipt validation, duplicate payment check and billing log transfer within Hive platform, and guarantees the item delivery transaction after payment.
It supports real-time monitoring environment through dashboard, and provides the necessary data to business, development, or management department by collecting payment log consistently.

<h4>Hive Item</h4>

Hive Item is a system for integrating and managing the delivery and retrieval features of game cash and item in games. In Hive item, you can provide game cash or items for in-app purchase, coupon use, rewards for cross-promotion, rewards for event, and other diverse reasons in games.

<h4>Hive Coupon</h4>

It is the feature of coupon issued from Hive Console. Users can receive game cash or items through in-game gift box if they input the promotion code delivered via SMS or email. Apple restrict the coupon service as a policy, so Hive Coupon is only available with Android-base devices. However, Hive delivers deep link URL with promo code, so iOS-base users also receive coupons via the URL.

<h2>Notification</h2>

Hive Notification supports Googleâ€™s FCM, Appleâ€™s APNS and Amazonâ€™s ADM.

<h4>Remote Push Notification</h4>

Remote push refers to sending push notifications to users remotely via push tokens collected in advance. Hive supports both Hive Console and the server API to send push notifications. The form of a push notification includes all the features supported by each push service and it also offers features to send deeplink URLs and custom data within a push.

<h4>Overwrite</h4>

Depending on the market policy, this feature only exposes the latest push when receiving a push from a duplicate code (based on the Hive Console). When registering a push, the registrar can choose whether to use the overwrite feature in the Hive Console. In this case, the old push will be overwritten with a new push if the user hasnâ€™t checked the previous push that used the same code.

<aside class="note">
<p class="">Filtering (based on the whether or not a user has agreed to receive advertisement notifications) will be applied only for push notifications sent from the Hive Console. Therefore, the push that the game server sends using the Hive push API should be limited to informational notifications.</p>

</aside>

<h4>Local Push Notification</h4>

Local push notification refers to a feature used to send notifications to users from the game client. To implement this feature easily, Hive SDK offers local push registration and removal APIs.

<h4>Time Zone and Summer Time</h4>

The Hive push will be applied with global timezones and daylight savings time.

For example, if you schedule a notification to be sent to U.S. local users at 6pm, there will be a three-hour time difference in receiving push notifications between users in New York City and users in Los Angeles. In contrast, it also offers a feature to send push notifications simultaneously, regardless of the region. In this case, if you set the time according to the designated format within the push message, the time will be converted based on the userâ€™s local time. The daylight savings time will be automatically applied to the server according to the region.

Whether or not to apply the time difference can be set by the registrar when he or she is creating a push campaign in the backoffice.
